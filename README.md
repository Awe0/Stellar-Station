- Stellar Station is an RPG where players must manage a space station hosting various species. It's akin to a rest stop in space
A floating rock, a hostile dump. It's perilous for travelers in transit to make a stop there.
Players will have to radically transform this inhospitable place into a welcoming haven.
Their missions will involve clearing debris and gathering and assembling available resources to establish exchanges with various species to meet their needs.
Through this project, I am not only developing technical skills in programming and game design; I am also enhancing my project management experience, problem-solving abilities, and letting my creativity flourish.
